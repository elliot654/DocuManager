# DocuManager

A Windows desktop application that allows users to add text files in multiple formats and quickly view word count data in one place.

## Description

DocuManager was built to help writers and copywriters manage word counts across different document formats without needing to open each file individually. The application provides a simple desktop interface where users can add files and immediately view content metrics in a unified view.

This project was developed as a complete, standalone tool for a real user workflow, focusing on usability and reliability rather than unnecessary complexity.

### Features
- Add files in multiple text-based formats (txt, rtf, odt, docx)
- Automatically extract and calculate word counts
- Centralized overview of document metrics
